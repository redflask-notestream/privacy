  <h1>Notestream Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: January 13, 2026</p>

  <p>Thank you for using Notestream. Your privacy is important to us and we are committed to protecting your personal information. It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website and applications.</p>

  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>This privacy policy is applicable to the Notestream app for mobile devices, which was developed by Red Flask.</p>

  <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
  <p>Notestream is an offline-first notes app. Your notes and personal content are stored locally on your device. We cannot see or access them.</p>

  <p>Notestream does not require an account, and we do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or contacts.</p>

  <p>The only information we may receive is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Optional information you provide if you contact us for support (for example, an email address or message content).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We do not use ads, and we do not sell your data.</p>

  <h2>Will your information be shared with anyone?</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or share your notes or personal content with anyone. The limited information we may receive (for example, your email if you contact us) is used only to provide support and is not shared with third parties, except as required by law.</p>

  <h2>Is your information transferred internationally?</h2>
  <p>Notestream does not store your notes or personal data on our servers. If you contact us for support, your message may be processed in the United States or other countries where we or our service providers operate.</p>

  <p>We may add optional online features in the future. If we add such features, data used for those features may also be processed or stored in countries where we or our service providers operate. We will update this policy before enabling such features.</p>

  <h2>How long do we keep your information?</h2>
  <p>We keep only the minimum personal information necessary to provide support, and only for as long as needed. Your notes remain fully under your control on your device.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will update the “Last updated” date above.</p>

  <h2>Contact us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how your information is handled, please contact us at <a href="mailto:redflask.dev@gmail.com">redflask.dev@gmail.com</a>.</p>
