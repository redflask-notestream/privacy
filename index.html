  <h1>Notestream Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: September 11, 2025</p>

  <p>Thank you for using Notestream. Your privacy is important to us and we are committed to protecting your personal information. It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website and applications.</p>

  <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
  <p>Notestream is an offline-first notes app. Your notes and personal content are stored locally on your device. We cannot see or access them.</p>
  <p>The only information we may collect is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your Google Play account details for processing purchases (Google handles the payment and shares only the minimum needed with us).</li>
    <li>Optional information you provide if you contact us for support (such as your email).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use cookies, trackers, or ads.</p>

  <h2>How do we handle purchases?</h2>
  <p>All payments and subscriptions are processed securely by <strong>Google Play</strong>. We do not store or have access to your credit card or payment details.</p>

  <h2>Will your information be shared with anyone?</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or share your notes or personal content with anyone. The limited information we may receive (for example, your email if you contact us) is used only to provide support and is not shared with third parties, except as required by law.</p>

  <h2>Is your information transferred internationally?</h2>
  <p>Since Notestream does not store your notes or personal data on our servers, there is no regular transfer of your personal information. If you contact us or make a purchase, basic account information may be processed in the United States through Google or other service providers.</p>

  <h2>How long do we keep your information?</h2>
  <p>We keep only the minimum personal information necessary to provide support or process purchases, and only for as long as needed. Your notes remain fully under your control on your device.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will update the “Last updated” date above.</p>

  <h2>Contact us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how your information is handled, please contact us at <a href="mailto:redflask.dev@gmail.com">redflask.dev@gmail.com</a>.</p>
